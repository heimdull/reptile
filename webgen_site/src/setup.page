h2. Setup

h3. Replication

Clearly, before you setup monitoring for your replication, it would be nice to actually have a master/slave replication already in place to monitor. But who am I to tell you how to do things.  Replication in MySQL is actually easy to set up, but a little fragile, which is why a monitor comes in handy. Here are some links to help you get started with replication.

h3. Setting up Monitoring

MySQL allows for fairly fine-grained permissions, and while you could always run everything as your root MySQL user, Reptile will at least facilitate using a better security policy. This means using users with specific permissions for specific tasks.  In addition to setting up some new users, Reptile requires a new database/table in order to read and write "<a href="terms/heartbeat.html">Heartbeats</a>," which is the best look at the "real time" latency of your system. We'll also try to help with that.

But give me some time!
